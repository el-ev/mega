## Database maintenance
Currently, the tables of database are created by `.sql` file. 

If you want to add a new table or modify the existing table, you need to update the `.sql` files which are located in the `sql` directory.

### Attention
- Each database corresponds to one `.sql` file, you must modify all of them if you want to update the tables in order to keep the consistency of the database.
- DO NOT use `Array` Type in PostgreSQL but use `JSON` instead, for compatibility with SQLite & MySQL. (`JSON` &lt;==&gt; `serde_json::Value`)
